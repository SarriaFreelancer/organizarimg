# **App Name**: Photo Mosaic Generator

## Core Features:

- Photo Upload and Management: Allows users to upload multiple photos, manage the order and remove photos as needed.
- Dynamic Canvas Generation: Generates a dynamic canvas with the selected layout (2, 4, or 6 photos per page) to accommodate the number of photos uploaded.
- Layout Selection: Provides options to display the photos on the canvas in different layouts such as 2 photos per page, 4 photos per page, or 6 photos per page.
- Canvas Expansion: Offers the ability to add more photos and dynamically extend the canvas with additional pages as needed.
- Image Cropping and Positioning Tool: Provides tools that let users center, crop, and properly arrange each image inside of each frame on the canvas.
- AI-Powered Layout: Recommends an optimal number of images per page by balancing canvas space use with visual coherence. The system employs a tool to consider both aesthetic and practical factors in generating the pages, allowing the canvas to intelligently resize as photos are added.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to give a calming and creative feel, evoking a sense of nostalgia, imagination, and memories.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F0F0), very desaturated, to keep the focus on the photos.
- Accent color: Muted violet (#946AA1), a color analogous to the primary lavender but darker and more saturated to contrast with the primary and background for calls to action.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for clean and modern readability.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font that pairs well with Inter.
- Use simple, outlined icons to represent different functionalities (upload, download, layout options).
- Maintain a clean and user-friendly layout, focusing on the image preview area.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations for uploading, generating, and downloading processes.
